// Sliding Window

/* contiguous - sharing a common border; touching.
a subarray is a contiguous section of the array. 
All the elements must be adjacent to each other in 
the original array and in their original order.
[1, 2, 3, 4]

[1], [2], [3], [4]
[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]
[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]



A subarray can be defined by two indices, the start and end. 

Whenever a problem description talks about subarrays,
you should figure out if sliding window is a good option
by analyzing the problem description.

Find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to k
Find the longest substring that has at most one "0"
Find the number of subarrays that have a product less than k
